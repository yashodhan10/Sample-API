# Sample-API
This sample code will create an API in Python using FLASK. 

API.py file contains the sample code to create API. In this file, I have created 2 APIs, "parse" and "parseInfo".
Input needed is sample files which are mentioned under import section. 
If we need to call these APIs repetitively, Luigi framework can be used. 
Luigi framework is to creak a workflow of tasks. More information is on: https://github.com/spotify/luigi
